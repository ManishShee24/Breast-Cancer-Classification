# Breast-Cancer-Classification
The detection of tumours in the breast depends on segmentation techniques. Segmentation plays a significant role in image analysis and includes detection, feature extraction, classification, and treatment. Segmentation helps physicians quantify the volume of tissue in the breast for treatment planning.

From the given dataset, I classified the breast cancer segmentation, here given the different type of error, so we classify that any person has how much level of cancer.
